# LaTeX Homework Template

This is the template that I use for typesetting homework assignments.

## Usage

The command `\homeworkproblem` creates a new page with an empty box to type the question prompt in. It takes two arguments: the problem number and the problem body. An example of this command is:

    \homeworkproblem{Problem 1}{This is a homework problem.}
